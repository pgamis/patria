Hi Jake,

Thanks for your email! You're almost done with your application to the **Intro to Android Development** course—it’s just one more step.

**Here’s what to do next:**
1. Complete the pre-work project outlined in the application portal. It’s called the *Task List App*.
2. Submit your GitHub repo by uploading it through the link at the bottom of the pre-work guide.

Once we’ve reviewed your project, we’ll send you your acceptance decision and placement.

The course starts on **May 20** and runs **Mondays and Wednesdays from 6:00–8:00 PM PT**, for 6 weeks.

Let us know if anything’s unclear or if you run into issues while submitting.

Best,  
*Pat from CodePath Admissions*
