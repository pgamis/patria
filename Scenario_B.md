Hi Jane,

Thank you so much for the time and care you put into your Flix app—it’s clear you really gave it your all, and we admire that kind of dedication.

I understand how disappointing it must be to learn that our program currently only accepts students enrolled in U.S.-based partner universities. As a nonprofit, our offerings are funded by specific sponsorships, and for now, that limits where we can offer full support. That said, we hear you—and you're definitely not alone in this situation.

We’re exploring ways to expand our programs globally in the future. In fact, we’ve previously run pilot courses in Taiwan and Haiti and would love to launch something in Southeast Asia.

In the meantime, here are a few things you can check out:

Please know your effort hasn’t gone unnoticed. You clearly have the motivation to keep learning, and we hope to cross paths again soon.

Warmly,  
*Pat from CodePath*
