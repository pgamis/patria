Hi Anne,

Thanks so much for getting in touch. We can tell how much this opportunity means to you—and we really respect how proactive you’ve been, especially with over 100 internship applications under your belt.

Unfortunately, our Summer Interview Prep course (starting **June 3**) is now full, and the waitlist is already quite long. Since you’re graduating this Spring, I know this is probably a tough pill to swallow.

While we can't offer you a seat this time, we’d love to still support you in your prep journey. Here are some free tools we think you’ll find helpful:
- [Software Interview Prep Guide](https://placeholder.link/interviewguide)
- [Mock Interview Practice Tools](https://placeholder.link/mockprep)

We also encourage you to join our **Tech Career Newsletter**, where we share job opportunities, open-access events, and new course announcements:

You’ve already shown incredible drive—don’t stop now.

Take care,  
*Pat from CodePath Admissions*
