Hi Dennis,

I appreciate you taking the time to reach out. I know how hard it can be to juggle everything, and I’m sorry things didn’t go as planned this time around.

Because of our course policy, students who miss a required assignment and don’t respond to outreach are automatically withdrawn to maintain fairness across the cohort. Since we didn’t hear back from you before the final deadline, your seat in **TIP101 – Spring Cohort** (which began March 5) was released.

That said, you’ll still have **lifetime access** to the full course content via your GitHub account (`denniscodes88`). You’re free to follow along on your own schedule, and many students have found success doing this self-paced.

If we open another round of TIP101 this fall, we’d love for you to apply again—we believe in second chances.

Thanks again for being part of the CodePath community.

Best,  
*Pat from CodePath Student Support*
