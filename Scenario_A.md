Hi John,

Thanks for reaching out, and congrats again on getting into our Technical Interview Prep program! We’re seriously impressed by your achievements—being a straight-A sophomore at MIT is no joke.

I know you’re eager to join the Advanced Track, but our placement decisions are based strictly on technical interview readiness as demonstrated in the pre-work. This ensures every student is placed in the right environment to grow and succeed—without feeling overwhelmed or underchallenged.

The Intermediate Track kicks off on **May 13** and meets **Tuesdays and Thursdays, 6:00–8:00 PM ET**. It covers many of the same foundational topics as the Advanced Track, especially in the first few weeks, but at a more supportive pace. You’ll be in great company with driven peers and instructors who’ll push you in the right way.

If you’re curious, here’s an overview:

Best,
